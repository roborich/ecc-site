Over the course of redemptive history, there have been several pivotal moments that revealed who our God is and what his saving purposes are for the world. For instance, the giving of the Law at Sinai, the building of the temple, and the ascension of the risen Lord Jesus. However, before the final moment in redemptive history takes place—the second coming of Christ—another event of monumental importance occurred ten days after the death and resurrection of Jesus. This unique and defining moment was the pouring out of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. In this sermon, Pastor Matt explains that to be filled with the Holy Spirit is to receive the spiritual presence of Jesus, which is the very power of God’s presence for the life and witness of his church.

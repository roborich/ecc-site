The ascension of the risen Lord Jesus and the sending of the Spirit are the two primary events in redemptive history that explain the incredible growth of the Christian church in Acts. However, between them, Luke includes the brief story of how another disciple was chosen to replace Judas as one of the twelve Apostles. While it may seem like a ‘side note’ to the main story, it is certainly not. In fact, the restoration of the twelve apostles is how Jesus began to restore the kingdom to Israel and is foundational to both the identity and the mission of his church in the world. In this sermon, Pastor Matt shows that the true people of God are those who hear the word of Christ—the gospel delivered by his chosen apostles—and respond in repentance and faith.

Today, we live in a secular age, where belief in God is simply one of many options available to us to improve our quality of life. We live in a distracted age, where we think and live only in materialistic terms, concerned with our immediate comfort and personal fulfillment, viewing this present life as all there is. However, the truth of the resurrection and ascension of Christ cuts through our distractions, disrupts our indifference, and proclaims that the risen Lord Jesus is the supreme and exalted King. In this sermon, Mitch Bedzyk teaches on the meaning of the ascension and encourages the church to serve our Lord and Savior with joy, praying and proclaiming his kingdom until his glorious return.

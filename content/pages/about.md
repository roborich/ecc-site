## Who We Are

[Since 1944](/our-history), Elmira Christian Center has seen God’s faithfulness and grace as we have labored together as a church to proclaim, preserve, and display the gospel. We can be described as _evangelical_ and _reformed_.

_Evangelical_ means we believe, proclaim, and rejoice in the good news of Jesus Christ: his life, death, and resurrection. We also embrace such doctrines as the inerrancy and sufficiency of Scripture, the Trinity, the centrality of the atonement, salvation by grace through faith, the importance of Christian witness, and the necessity of personal conversion. At ECC, it is all about [the gospel](/the-gospel).

_Reformed_ means our theological heritage and identity is that of the 16th century Protestant Reformation. We affirm the _five solas_ of the Reformation—that salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone, to the glory of God alone, and that the church is to always be reformed according to Scripture alone.

For more information about who we are and what our church believes, check out our [Statement of Faith](/statement-of-faith), [distinctives](/distinctives), and the [Creeds and Confessions](/creeds-and-confessions) we joyfully affirm along with other believers.

## Our Mission

Our mission as a church is how we make disciples and change our community. There is nothing new or unique about us. We joyfully share the same Scriptural mission with all true Christian churches.

### Experiencing Life Together

Disciples of Jesus are made when the members of the church, the body of Christ, experience life centered on God’s Word together; “life-on-life” discipleship. In the book of Acts, we see that the early church “devoted themselves to the apostles’ teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers” (Acts 2:42). Whether in our Lord’s Day gatherings, community groups, over a meal, or by simply enjoying life together, we strongly believe that Christianity is a corporate matter and that the Christian life can be fully realized only in relation to others. This conviction is emphasized and reflected in our church [membership](/membership) [covenant](/covenant).

### Centering Life on God’s Word

Our worship of God and fellowship with other believers is informed by the inerrant, inspired, and all-sufficient Word of God. We believe that “all Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work” (2 Timothy 3:16-17). We mature as disciples, and continue making other disciples, as we grow in the grace and knowledge of God as revealed in Scripture. This conviction is realized in everything we do here at ECC—our [preaching](/sermons), teaching, [liturgy](/our-liturgy), [community groups](/community-groups), [evangelism](/evangelism), prayer, singing, and fellowship.

### Connecting our Community to Christ

And finally, in the Great Commission, our Lord commands us to go and “make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you” (Matthew 28:19-20). We are implored to reach our communities with the good news of Jesus Christ, calling them to repentance and reconciliation with God; the genuine love that we abundantly show to them is found in the person of our Lord and Savior. Only by connecting people to the life-changing power of the good news of Jesus Christ will we be able to truly bring about lasting change to our families, friends, neighbors, co-workers, communities, cities, and the nations.
